Shiny R Developer, Assessment Systems International a.s., Remote, 2018 - 2019,
• I worked under contract to develop an R application with a Shiny front‑end for machine‑learning‑driven assessment of candidates based on
psychometric data, and I,
— created a proof-of-concept that was accepted for further development
— wrote the client-side components
— designed and implemented a web UI in Shiny that enabled interactive navigation through the ML‑model‑building process and enabled the user to save and reuse the resulting model
— coordinated project management remotely with the client using agile methodology
• The application drew on R packages to provide feature selection methods, classification and regression algorithms, and ensemble models, specifically elastic net models (glmnet), tree‑based models (rpart), support vector machines (svmRadial), random forest (rf), neural networks (nnet),and k‑nearest neighbour (knn)
• The application enabled the client to engage consultants with no programming experience and increased the effectiveness of the assessment process
