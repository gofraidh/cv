     "Exploratory Multivariate Data Analysis (MOOC) by FranÃ§ois Husson, Professor of statistics. The course focused on four essential and basic methods: principal component analysis (PCA) to handle quantitative variables, correspondence analysis (CA) and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to handle categorical variables and clustering, and an extension to Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to analyse a more complex dataset that is structured by groups",

     "Summer School of Causal inference with observational data: the challenges and pitfalls (5 days course). This five-day summer school offered state-of-the-art training in the analysis of observational data for causal inference. By exploring the philosophy and utility of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) participants learn to recognise and avoid a range of common pitfalls in the analysis of complex causal relationships, including the longitudinal analyses of change, mediation, nonlinearity and statistical interaction",
